## Problem defenition

### Introduction
In today's highly competitive business landscape, customer retention is of utmost importance for companies seeking sustainable growth and profitability. Understanding and predicting customer churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company, is crucial for businesses to proactively address customer attrition and implement effective retention strategies.


### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn.
 

### Problem Statement
The problem at hand can be defined as follows: Given the historical customer data, including features related to demographics, usage behavior, and customer interactions, the task is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn within a specified time frame. The model should provide a probability score or classification for each customer, indicating the likelihood of churn.
